# Class Design and Implementation Case

#### A large company with locations in different cities has taken an OOP approach in creating an administration program that manages all aspects of its business. These aspects include:
#### ·the sale of all the different products that the company manages
#### ·the salaries for managers, office staff and sales personnel.

#### 1.(a) By making use of an example from the above scenario, distinguish between a class and an instantiation of a class. (3 points)
Class: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It represents a concept or a category of objects that share common attributes and methods. In the given scenario, a class could be "Product" or "Employee," which define the common properties and behaviors for all products and employees in the company.

Instantiation: Instantiation refers to the process of creating an object (instance) of a class. It involves allocating memory for the object and initializing its attributes based on the class definition. For example, if we have a class "Product," an instantiation of that class would be creating an object like "laptop" or "mobile phone," where each object has its specific attributes and values assigned.
